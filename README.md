# Personal AI Tools

This repo contains tools I have built to enable me to use AI more easily in my daily workflows. They are mostly commands and scripts for having Claude interact with Jira, Confluence, Gitlab, and other things so I don't have to.

## Tools

- **jira-export** - Exports Jira tickets with full history and custom fields to JSON for AI analysis (run with `--help-ai` for detailed usage)
- **jira-api** - Bash wrapper for Jira REST API with keychain authentication (includes comprehensive usage docs and field IDs in script)
- **confluence-api** - Bash wrapper for Confluence REST API with keychain authentication (includes comprehensive usage docs in script)
- **calendar-link** - Generates Google Calendar event URLs from command line parameters
- **gitlab-api** - Bash wrapper for GitLab REST API with keychain authentication
